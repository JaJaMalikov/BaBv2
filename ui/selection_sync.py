"""Module for synchronizing selection and simple UI model change notifications.

DEPRECATION NOTICE (docs/tasks.md ยง23):
- Direct traversal of `win.object_manager.graphics_items` couples UI to internals.
  This will migrate to a selection service/facade emitting events and providing
  query APIs. Keep calls here stable until the facade is introduced.

Temporary event emission (docs/tasks.md ยง7):
- Provide a minimal, loosely-coupled hook to notify UI widgets that the
  underlying model has changed so they can refresh themselves without direct
  cross-calls between unrelated UI modules.
